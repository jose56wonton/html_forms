# Html_forms
This is my second HTML/CSS project. The purpose of this project is to work on
my list and form skills. This is a clone of the [Mint](https://mint.intuit.com/login.event?task=S&utm_medium=direct&test=&cta=nav_sign_up_dropdown) sign up page.

This project is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) Rails track.
The project itself can be seen [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/html-forms)!
